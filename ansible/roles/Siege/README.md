# Ansible role `Siege`
Installs the loadtesting tool siege 3.1.0 on centos7 as a role in an ansible environment.

An Ansible role for installing `Siege` on RHEL/CentOS 7. Specifically, the responsibilities of this role are to:

- Install Siege version 3.1.0
- Set up the host as a server

## What is Siege?
Siege is a benchmarking and load testing tool that can be used to measure the performance of a web server when under immense pressure. Siege performs following tests:
- Amount of data transferred.
- Response time of server.
- Transaction rate.
- Throughput.
- Concurrency.
- Times the program returned ok.

## Siege provides three modes of operation:

Regression.
Internet Simulation.
Brute Force.

For more information about this loadtesting tools, I recommend to visit the [`Official website`](https://www.joedog.org/siege-home/).

The following things will be done during the installation of this role:
- Update and upgrade your server
- Install Siege version 3.1.0
- install the `Development tools` package group

## Getting started


## Requirements

At this moment, we are using a vagrant-environment. The role will be installed in the home directory of the vagrant-host. More info about how to use Vagrant, u can find [`here`] (https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/).

## Important files
### .siegerc
As mentioned before, the roll will be installed in the home directory of the vagrant host ( `Home/vagrant/` ). If you use the `list -a` -command in this directory, you will notice a file called `.siegerc` .

In this file you got the opportunity to edit the settings of your load. For example you can change howmany concurrent users will be simulated. By default Siege configuration suggests 25 concurrent users over a period of 1 minute.  Uncomment the variables shown below, and also if you want any other commented settings then don’t forget to remove the pound sign (`#`)
List of settings you can edit here.
