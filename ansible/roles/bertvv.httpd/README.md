# Ansible role `httpd`

A simple Ansible role for installing and configuring the Apache web server for RHEL/CentOS 7 and Fedora 21+. Specifically, the responsibilities of this role are to:

- Install the necessary packages;
- Maintain the main configuration file;
- Maintain the configuration file for `mod_ssl`.
- Install support for scripting language (currently only PHP)

HTTPS/TLS is enabled, by default using the standard self-signed certificate. You can provide your own certificate by setting the appropriate role variables.

Currently, no virtual hosts or other features are provided.

## Requirements

- The firewall settings are not managed by this role.
- If you want to use custom certificates, you have to make sure that they are installed on the system before applying this role.

## Role Variables

If no variables are set, applying this role will result in a configuration equivalent to the default install. Consequently, no variables are required.

## Dependencies

No dependencies.

## Example Playbook

See the [test playbook](tests/test.yml)

## Testing

The `tests` directory contains acceptance tests for this role in the form of a Vagrant environment. The directory `tests/roles/httpd` is a symbolic link that should point to the root of this project in order to work. To create it, do

```ShellSession
$ cd tests/
$ ln -frs ../../bertvv.httpd roles/httpd
```

You may want to change the base box into one that you like. The current one is based on Box-Cutter's [CentOS Packer template](https://github.com/boxcutter/centos).

The playbook [`test.yml`](tests/test.yml) applies the role to a VM, setting role variables.
